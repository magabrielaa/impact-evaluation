# Impact Evaluation

This repository contains code and analysis in R, employing different econometrics techniques for impact evaluation examples with a policy focus. Each sub-repository includes the data as .csv files for replication.

I have also included the knitted PDF files for easier readability of the formulas.

Some of the methods implemented include:

- Linear regression
- RCT
- Matching
- Difference-in-Differences
- Instrumental Variable (IV)
- Regression Discontinuity (RD)
